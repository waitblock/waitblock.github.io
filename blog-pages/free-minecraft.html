    <h2>Getting Minecraft for Free (Technically)</h2>
    <h5>Published March 5th, 2021.</h5>
    <p>If you've ever wanted to play Minecraft for free, you should probably read this article.</p>
    <p>So as you may or may not know, Minecraft has a demo version for you to try the game for 100 minutes. However, it is possible to change some data files and get the next best thing to unlimited time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm going to list out the steps here: </p>
    <ol>1. Go to <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft's ofiicial website</a> and register a Mojang account.</ol>
    <ol>2. Download and install Minecraft for your operating system.</ol>
    <ol>3. Open the Minecraft launcher and then sign into your Mojang account.</ol>
    <ol>4. Launch Minecraft and then press the "Play Demo World" button. After the world loads in, and you see a screen explaining how you only have 100 minutes for the demo world, close the window.</ol>
    <ol>5. Open the file explorer for your operating system (ex. Finder for MacOS), and type "Minecraft" into the search bar. Once you see a folder titled 'minecraft' or 'Minecraft', double-click on that folder to open it. If you don't see such a folder, try reinstalling Minecraft.</ol>
    <ol>6. In the Minecraft folder, you should see a folder called 'saves' or 'Saves'. Double-click on the saves folder to open it. If you don't happen to see that folder, try loading in the world again.</ol>
    <ol>7. In the saves folder, you should only see one folder named 'Demo_World' or 'demo_world'. Double click on that to open it, and you should see a file called 'level.dat' in the demo world folder. Again, if you don't see a demo world folder or a level file, try loading in the world again.</ol>
    <ol>8. Go to <a href="http://irath96.github.io/webNBT/">this website</a>, which is an NBT file editor. This is what we will use to give us unlimited time.</ol>
    <ol>9. Next, drag and drop your 'level.dat' file into the NBT Editor.</ol>
    <ol>10. Dropdown the data value, and then scroll down a bit. You should see a value called time. Double click on that, and when the website asks you for a new value, enter this value: -9223372036854655508. Then click the blue save button at the top of the website, and then the new level file will be downloaded.</ol>
